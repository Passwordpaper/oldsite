	<h2>Why does your site look like this?</h2>
	<p>I am not a web designer. Here are the things I want for this site:
	<ul>
		<li>The site loads quickly.
		<li>The site looks about the same an any device
		<li>The site is legible.
		<li>The site can be read by a machine, both for accessibility reasons and so I can scrape the text out of it easily and put it somewhere else.
		<li>The site is easy to code.
	</ul>
	<p>I have opted to just use HTML. This is what a website was born to be.

	<h2>Why "passwordpaper" for a name?</h2>
	<p>This is a reference to my first password manager. Two things that cause passwords to be bad are when they are made up of easy things to remember (and therefore guess) and when they are reused. In a simpler time when we only had to keep track of 10 passwords or so, one way to do that was to make truly random passwords and writing them all on an index card you could keep in your wallet. People already know how to keep little pieces of paper in their wallet safe, and the only dangers were that someone would steal your wallet or look over your shoulder while you pulled out your password paper. In general, people weren't typing passwords around people they did not trust, and you could keep an extra index card at home in case your wallet was lost or stolen. In that case, you would need to change all of your passwords quickly and make new cards, but it was still a better system than using your dog's name, your favorite number, and your old school mascot all smushed together as your password for everything.
