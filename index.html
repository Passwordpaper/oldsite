	<h2>Why does your site look like this?</h2>
	<p>I am not a web designer. Here are the things I want for this site:
	<ul>
		<li>The site loads quickly.
		<li>The site looks about the same an any device.
		<li>The site is legible.
		<li>The site can be read by a machine for accessibility reasons and so I can scrape the text out of it easily and put it somewhere else.
		<li>The site is simple enough that it can't be taken over by malware.
	</ul>
	<p>I have opted to code a static site with HTML. I found an open source template for the css because, again, I am not a web designer.

	<h2>Why "passwordpaper" for a name?</h2>
	<p>Two things that cause passwords to be bad are when they are made up of easy things to remember (and therefore guess) and when they are reused. In a simpler time when we only had to keep track of 10 passwords or so, one way to avoid bad passwords was to make random-enough passwords with a random number generator and to write them all on an index card you could keep in your wallet. People already know how to keep little pieces of paper in their wallet safe, and it was a better system than using your dog's name, your favorite number, and your old school mascot all smushed together as your password for everything. It is not a reference to keeping the password to your computer on a sticky note attached to your computer, which is mostly a bad idea.
